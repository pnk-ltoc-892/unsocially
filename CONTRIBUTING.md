### 🎯 Code Style Guide

To keep the codebase clean and consistent:

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for React components
- Avoid unnecessary files, unused code, or comments
- Use `.env` files for all secrets/config (never hardcode!)
- Remove unused imports, variables, and console logs
- Ensure consistent spacing and indentation
- Use **ESLint** or **Prettier** if configured
